   ************* Beginning System Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** The Standard Ratings is calculated for Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed = DX COOLING COIL_UNIT1 but not at the AHRI test condition due to curve out of bound.
   **   ~~~   **  Review the Standard Ratings calculations in the Engineering Reference for this coil type. Also, use Output:Diagnostics, DisplayExtraWarnings for further guidance.
   ** Warning ** Coil:WaterHeating:AirToWaterHeatPump:Wrapped "HEAT PUMP WATER HEATER EVAPORATOR_UNIT1": Rated air volume flow rate per watt of rated total water heating capacity is out of range
   **   ~~~   ** Min Rated Vol Flow Per Watt=[4.027E-005], Rated Vol Flow Per Watt=[1.260E-004], Max Rated Vol Flow Per Watt=[8.056E-005]. See Input-Output Reference Manual for valid range.
   ** Warning ** Water heater = WATER HEATER_TANK_UNIT1:  Recovery Efficiency and Energy Factor could not be calculated during the test for standard ratings
   **   ~~~   ** Setpoint was never recovered and/or heater never turned on
   ** Warning ** Check input. Pump nominal power or motor efficiency is set to 0, for pump=MAINS PRESSURE_UNIT1
   ** Warning ** ValidateDistributionSystem: Heat pump water heater is simulated along with an AirflowNetwork but is not included in the AirflowNetwork.
   ** Warning ** ValidateDistributionSystem: A ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator is simulated along with an AirflowNetwork but is not included in the AirflowNetwork.
