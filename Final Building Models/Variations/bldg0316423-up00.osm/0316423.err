   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Zone Floor Areas differ from calculated Zone Floor Area(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 2 zones are not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** DetermineShadowingCombinations: There are 1 surfaces which are receiving surfaces and are non-convex.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Shadowing values may be inaccurate. Check .shd report file for more surface shading details
   **   ~~~   ** ...Add Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to see individual warnings for each surface.
   ** Severe  ** DetermineShadowingCombinations: There are 1 surfaces which are casting surfaces and are non-convex.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Shadowing values may be inaccurate. Check .shd report file for more surface shading details
   **   ~~~   ** ...Add Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to see individual severes for each surface.
   ** Warning ** The Standard Ratings is calculated for Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed = RES AC COOLING COIL but not at the AHRI test condition due to curve out of bound.
   **   ~~~   **  Review the Standard Ratings calculations in the Engineering Reference for this coil type. Also, use Output:Diagnostics, DisplayExtraWarnings for further guidance.
   ** Warning ** Check input. Pump nominal power or motor efficiency is set to 0, for pump=PUMP VARIABLE SPEED 1
