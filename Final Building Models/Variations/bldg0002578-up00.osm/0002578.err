   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Zone Floor Areas differ from calculated Zone Floor Area(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Severe  ** For zone: UNFINISHED ATTIC ZONE it is not possible to calculate the volume from the surrounding surfaces so either provide the volume value or define all the surfaces to fully enclose the zone.
   ** Warning ** Indicated Zone Volume <= 0.0 for Zone=UNFINISHED ATTIC ZONE
   **   ~~~   ** The calculated Zone Volume was=0.00
   **   ~~~   ** The simulation will continue with the Zone Volume set to 10.0 m3. 
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 1 zone is not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 2 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** DetermineShadowingCombinations: There are 1 surfaces which are receiving surfaces and are non-convex.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Shadowing values may be inaccurate. Check .shd report file for more surface shading details
   **   ~~~   ** ...Add Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to see individual warnings for each surface.
   ** Severe  ** DetermineShadowingCombinations: There are 1 surfaces which are casting surfaces and are non-convex.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Shadowing values may be inaccurate. Check .shd report file for more surface shading details
   **   ~~~   ** ...Add Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to see individual severes for each surface.
   ** Warning ** DeterminePolygonOverlap: Too many figures [>200]  detected in an overlap calculation. Use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; for more details.
   ** Warning ** Check input. Pump nominal power or motor efficiency is set to 0, for pump=PUMP VARIABLE SPEED 1
   ** Warning ** Missing temperature setpoint for LeavingSetpointModulated mode Boiler named RES BOILER GAS
   **   ~~~   **   A temperature setpoint is needed at the outlet node of a boiler in variable flow mode
   **   ~~~   **   use a Setpoint Manager to establish a setpoint at the boiler outlet node 
   **   ~~~   **   or use an EMS actuator to establish a setpoint at the boiler outlet node 
   **   ~~~   **   The overall loop setpoint will be assumed for Boiler. The simulation continues ...
