   ** Warning ** CalcEquipmentFlowRates: Target water temperature is greater than the hot water temperature
   **   ~~~   **  During Warmup, Environment=RUN PERIOD 1, at Simulation time=01/01 14:30 - 14:45
   **   ~~~   ** ...target water temperature       = 52.666 C
   **   ~~~   ** ...hot water temperature       = 50.546 C
   **   ~~~   ** ...Note: target water temperature should be less than or equal to the hot water temperature
   **   ~~~   ** ...Target water temperature should be less than or equal to the hot water temperature. Verify temperature setpoints and schedules.
   ** Warning ** CalcDoe2DXCoil: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed "RES ROOM AC COOLING COIL 1" - Air-cooled condenser inlet dry-bulb temperature below 0 C. Outdoor dry-bulb temperature = -6.00

   **   ~~~   ** ... Operation at low ambient temperatures may require special performance curves.
   ** Warning ** CalcDoe2DXCoil: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed "RES ROOM AC COOLING COIL 1" - Full load outlet air dry-bulb temperature < 2C. This indicates the possibility of coil frost/freeze. Outlet temperature = 1.21 C.
   **   ~~~   **  ...Occurrence info = RUN PERIOD 1, 01/01 00:00 - 00:15
   **   ~~~   ** ... Possible reasons for low outlet air dry-bulb temperatures are: This DX coil
   **   ~~~   **    1) may have a low inlet air dry-bulb temperature. Inlet air temperature = 23.889 C.
   **   ~~~   **    2) may have a low air flow rate per watt of cooling capacity. Check inputs.
   **   ~~~   **    3) is used as part of a HX assisted cooling coil which uses a high sensible effectiveness. Check inputs.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-ELECTRICITY" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
