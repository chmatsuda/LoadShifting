   ** Warning ** Output:PreprocessorMessage="GroundTempCalc - Slab" has the following Warning condition:
   **   ~~~   ** Slab thickness [0.100 m] reset to 0.122 m  for computational stability.
   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 1 zone is not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 13 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** GetAirflowNetworkInput: AirflowNetwork:SimulationControl object, 
   **   ~~~   ** ..Specified AirflowNetwork Control = "MultizoneWithDistribution" and ZoneVentilation:* objects are present.
   **   ~~~   ** ..ZoneVentilation objects will not be simulated.
   ************* Beginning System Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** The Standard Ratings is calculated for Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed = DX COOLING COIL_UNIT1 but not at the AHRI test condition due to curve out of bound.
   **   ~~~   **  Review the Standard Ratings calculations in the Engineering Reference for this coil type. Also, use Output:Diagnostics, DisplayExtraWarnings for further guidance.
   ** Warning ** Check input. Pump nominal power or motor efficiency is set to 0, for pump=MAINS PRESSURE_UNIT1
   ** Warning ** ValidateDistributionSystem: A ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator is simulated along with an AirflowNetwork but is not included in the AirflowNetwork.
   ** Warning ** CalcEquipmentFlowRates: Target water temperature is greater than the hot water temperature
   **   ~~~   **  During Warmup, Environment=DENVER-AURORA-BUCKLEY.AFB_CO_USA ANN CLG .4% CONDNS DB=>MWB, at Simulation time=07/21 00:00 - 00:10
   **   ~~~   ** ...target water temperature       = 48.889 C
   **   ~~~   ** ...hot water temperature       = 48.883 C
   **   ~~~   ** ...Note: target water temperature should be less than or equal to the hot water temperature
   **   ~~~   ** ...Target water temperature should be less than or equal to the hot water temperature. Verify temperature setpoints and schedules.
